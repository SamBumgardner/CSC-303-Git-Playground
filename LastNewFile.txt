So i was watching rick and morty right, and it was just a casual night and i was just watching rick and morty. 
Well, out of nowhere the funniest thing happened. Rick and Morty, Season 3, Episode 3, 56 seconds in. 
At the time, this was happening, The scientist guy, Rick, was nowhere to be found. 
Morty tried to look for him but all he found was just a mere little pickle on the desk. 
You know what happened? He heard ricks voice, somewhere around the room. 
Morty used a screwdriver to flip the pickle over and...you’ll never believe this, IT WAS RICK! HE WAS A PICKLE!! 
I kid you not, he’s called PICKLE RICK! PICKLE RICK!!! LMAO!!!! I was rolling on the floor laughing! 
My chest was in pain and i almost felt that i was going to suffocate!! 
Funniest thing i’d ever seen, i’ll tell you that. Im still laughing thinking about it. Awww man, you had to be there. It was just so funny.
