I want food
----------------------------------------------------------------
Cluckin' Bell Employee: Can I take your order, please?
 
Big Smoke: Carl, what do you want? You gotta eat to keep your strength up, man.
 
Carl Johnson: Hey, I'll take a number 9 - fat boy.
 
Ryder: Gimme a number 9, just like his.
 
Sweet: Let me get a number 6 with extra dip.
 
Big Smoke: I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.
